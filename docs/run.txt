Run health checks
#################

Run health checks to make sure everything is ok. As an example, run health
checks after a deployment to verify configuration, services...

Health checks are tests having a ``is_healthcheck`` attribute which is
``True``. Let's use this feature to capture and run the tests.

With `nose` (here we run health checks of `hospital` project):

.. code:: sh

   nosetests --no-path-adjustment --all-modules --attr="is_healthcheck" hospital

.. tip::

   You may want to skip health checks when you run unit/functional/integration
   tests. With `nose`, it could be:

   .. code:: sh

      nosetests --no-path-adjustment --all-modules --attr="!is_healthcheck" hospital
